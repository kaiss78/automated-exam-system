**In the current method of creating exams papers at ESL is ESL’s teachers have two method types to generate exams:**
| **Process** | **Description**|
|:------------|:---------------|
| First method | Some ESL’s teachers still work manually to write exams’ papers that they open word document and fill it by questions. As a result, they spend much time to find important questions that they need and the same time, they also make much effort to organize exam’s paper format. |
| Second method | Another method, ESL’s teachers have a few number of books that contain generator automatic exam on CDs but they face many problems with that. First issue is the limit number of questions for each book and they cannot add a new question, edit question, or delete question. Besides that, they do not have ability to change exam’s paper format and they are forced by book’s company to put their logos or specific information that is not important in exam’s paper.|
