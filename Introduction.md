# Project name: #
> Automated Exam System

# Summary: #
> An Automated Exam website that generates models of different exams with answers.

# Project description: #
> Our website generates models of different exams. This website makes a database of questions depending on class subjects, chapters, question types (multiple choice or true/false) and the difficulty level of questions (easy – medium –hard).
> Users have the ability to produce random questions on two hardcopies. One of them contains questions and the second has the answers to the questions.
> In addition, this website can avoid redundant questions that repeat frequently.
> This website is different than other websites that rely on online versions of exam because our website creates paper exams.

# Objectives: #
> This website system may help teachers inside their schools who are busy because they have a huge number of students and many different courses and sections.

# potential customers: #
